“ Customer Behavior Dashboard built in Power BI. It tracks how different factors like category, gender, and subscription status influence customer spending.
I highlighted KPIs like number of customers, average purchase amount, and review rating.
From this, I identified that clothing brings the most revenue, young customers are the biggest buyers, and there’s potential to increase subscriptions.
It’s an interactive dashboard designed for quick insights and strategic decision-making.”
